This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

In this project i know i have lacked at execution part and I really feel that I am more kind of detailed person so as of i didn't got some clue to dig into real part to visualise data in my way as of i am searching towards it to explore more ways show that I can show data more fluently and in detailed and animated way as I am an artist.

First part of this is fetching data from the Google sheet in which asks user, to enter spreadsheet url and select type of visualisation they want if we will have category



Second part is dealing with data and conversion to object and array and adding some data from api such as Google maps or mapbox or ....

And then , using that data to visualise using any library pre built-in or through our own css to build graph or something.


see i have researched a lot and gone through various libraries and their functioning like deck.gl
and library developed by uber like kepler.gl but their working is bit complex and to get its breakdown to use as per our usage to have weekely data inlcuded in it it will take some time . even if we are doing geostationary ploting it will take some time .i am exploring that part as well as looking to desing a box kinda css animation that will show the data as packet and as per population density it will fill up the box.


for example i had past experience with website https://www.quicksoftwaresolutions.au/ in which i had faced many difficulties like in its header their is a scroll animation in each page .


so at last i must say i tried my best to explore and i would like to thank the team to get me included in this externship; where i explored this much and as of there was midsem so i didnt got that much time to complete it or execute properly but will definetely work upon this in future and once i will complete some work i wil show in on my own.
